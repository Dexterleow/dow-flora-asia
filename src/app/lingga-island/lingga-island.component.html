        Ferry services to the islands from outside the archipelago come from the provincial capital to the north, Tanjung Pinang
        on Bintan, including from Singapore. These days the main industry is fishing. There are a number of fine beaches
        with some coral around the Archipelago but there is very little tourism on account of the poor transport links
        with the outside world.
